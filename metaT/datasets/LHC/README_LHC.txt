-LHC.diatoms.MATOUv1.5.seqs.function
All Tara Oceans sequences from diatom LHCs and their classification into the subfamilies.

-LHCs.diatoms.MATOUv1.5.Pfam.cdhit80.ADDref.globalpair.gt01.fasta
Alignment of the LHC Pfam domain region from the Tara Oceans dataset against reference genome sequences. To reduce redundancy, Tara Oceans sequences were clustered at 80% identity, retaining only one representative sequence per cluster.
